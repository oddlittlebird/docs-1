The cursor will be removed on the server automatically after the specified amount of time. This is useful to ensure garbage collection of cursors that are not fully fetched by clients. If not set, a server-defined value will be used (default: 30 seconds).\n  - **query**: contains the query string to be executed\n  - **bindVars** (object): key/value pairs representing the bind parameters.\n  - **options**:\n    - **failOnWarning**: When set to *true*, the query will throw an exception and abort instead of producing a warning. This option should be used during development to catch potential issues early. When the attribute is set to *false*, warnings will not be propagated to exceptions and will be returned with the query result. There is also a server configuration option `--query.fail-on-warning` for setting the default value for *failOnWarning* so it does not need to be set on a per-query level.\n    - **profile**: If set to *true* or *1*, then the additional query profiling information will be returned in the sub-attribute *profile* of the *extra* return attribute, if the query result is not served from the query cache. Set to *2* the query will include execution stats per query plan node in sub-attribute *stats.nodes* of the *extra* return attribute. Additionally the query plan is returned in the sub-attribute *extra.plan*.\n    - **maxTransactionSize**: Transaction size limit in bytes. \n    - **stream**: Specify *true* and the query will be executed in a **streaming** fashion. The query result is not stored on the server, but calculated on the fly. *Beware*: long-running queries will need to hold the collection locks for as long as the query cursor exists. When set to *false* a query will be executed right away in its entirety. In that case query results are either returned right away (if the result set is small enough), or stored on the database instance and accessible via the cursor API (with respect to the `ttl`). It is advisable to *only* use this option on short-running queries or without exclusive locks . Query statistics, warnings and profiling data will only be available after the query is finished.\n    The default value is *false*\n    - **skipInaccessibleCollections**: C8QL queries (especially graph traversals) will treat collection to which a user has no access rights as if these collections were empty. Instead of returning a forbidden access error, your queries will execute normally. \n    - **maxWarningCount**: Limits the maximum number of warnings a query will return. The number of warnings a query will return is limited to 10 by default, but that number can be increased or decreased by setting this attribute.\n    - **intermediateCommitCount**: Maximum number of operations after which an intermediate commit is performed automatically. \n  - **fullCount**: if set to *true* and the query contains a *LIMIT* clause, then the result will have an *extra* attribute with the sub-attributes *stats* and *fullCount*, `{ ... , \"extra\": { \"stats\": { \"fullCount\": 123 } } }`. The *fullCount* attribute will contain the number of documents in the result before the last top-level LIMIT in the query was applied. It can be used to count the number of documents that match certain filter criteria, but only return a subset of them, in one go. It is thus similar to MySQL's *SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS* hint. Note that setting the option will disable a few LIMIT optimizations and may lead to more documents being processed, and thus make queries run longer. Note that the *fullCount* attribute may only be present in the result if the query has a top-level LIMIT clause and the LIMIT clause is actually used in the query.\n    - **intermediateCommitSize**: Maximum total size of operations after which an intermediate commit is performed automatically. \n    - **optimizer.rules** (string): A list of to-be-included or to-be-excluded optimizer rules can be put into this attribute, telling the optimizer to include or exclude specific rules. To disable a rule, prefix its name with a `-`, to enable a rule, prefix it with a `+`.

For data-modification queries, the *extra.stats* sub-attribute will contain the number of modified documents and the number of documents that could not be modified due to an error (if *ignoreErrors* query option is specified)\n- **cached**: a boolean flag indicating whether the query result was served from the query cache or not.

The request must contain the following attributes.\n\nA JSON object with these properties is required:\n\n  - **sort**: body (JavaScript) code of a custom comparison function for the edges. The signature of this function is *(l, r) -> integer* (where l and r are edges) and must return -1 if l is smaller than, +1 if l is greater than, and 0 if l and r are equal. The reason for this is the following: The order of edges returned for a certain vertex is undefined. This is because there is no natural order of edges for a vertex with multiple connected edges. To explicitly define the order in which edges on the vertex are followed, you can specify an edge comparator function with this attribute. Note that the value here has to be a string to conform to the JSON standard, which in turn is parsed as function body on the server side. Furthermore note that this attribute is only used for the standard expanders. If you use your custom expander you have to do the sorting yourself within the expander code.\n  - **direction**: direction for traversal\n   - *if set*, must be either *\"outbound\"*, *\"inbound\"*, or *\"any\"*\n   - *if not set*, the *expander* attribute must be specified\n  - **minDepth**: ANDed with any existing filters): visits only nodes in at least the given depth\n  - **startVertex**: id of the startVertex, e.g. *\"users/foo\"*.\n  - **visitor**: body (JavaScript) code of custom visitor function function signature: *(config, result, vertex, path, connected) -> void* The visitor function can do anything, but its return value is ignored. To populate a result, use the *result* variable by reference. Note that the *connected* argument is only populated when the *order* attribute is set to *\"preorder-expander\"*.\n  - **itemOrder**: item iteration order can be *\"forward\"* or *\"backward\"*\n  - **strategy**: traversal strategy can be *\"depthfirst\"* or *\"breadthfirst\"*\n  - **filter**: default is to include all nodes: body (JavaScript code) of custom filter function function signature: *(config, vertex, path) -> mixed* can return four different string values:\n   - *\"exclude\"* -> this vertex will not be visited.\n   - *\"prune\"* -> the edges of this vertex will not be followed.\n   - *\"\"* or *undefined* -> visit the vertex and follow its edges.\n   - *Array* -> containing any combination of the above. If there is at least one *\"exclude\"* or *\"prune\"* respectively is contained, it's effect will occur.\n  - **init**: body (JavaScript) code of custom result initialization function function signature: *(config, result) -> void* initialize any values in result with what is required\n  - **maxIterations**: Maximum number of iterations in each traversal. This number can be set to prevent endless loops in traversal of cyclic graphs. When a traversal performs as many iterations as the *maxIterations* value, the traversal will abort with an error. If *maxIterations* is not set, a server-defined value may be used.\n  - **maxDepth**: ANDed with any existing filters visits only nodes in at most the given depth\n  - **uniqueness**: specifies uniqueness for vertices and edges visited.\n   If set, must be an object like this:\n   `\"uniqueness\": {\"vertices\": \"none\"|\"global\"|\"path\", \"edges\": \"none\"|\"global\"|\"path\"}`\n  - **order**: traversal order can be *\"preorder\"*, *\"postorder\"* or *\"preorder-expander\"*\n  - **graphName**: name of the graph that contains the edges. Either *edgeCollection* or *graphName* has to be given. In case both values are set the *graphName* is preferred.\n  - **expander**: body (JavaScript) code of custom expander function *must* be set if *direction* attribute is **not** set function signature: *(config, vertex, path) -> array* expander must return an array of the connections for *vertex* each connection is an object with the attributes *edge* and *vertex*\n  - **edgeCollection**: name of the collection that contains the edges.\n\nIf the Traversal is successfully executed *HTTP 200* will be returned.\n\nAdditionally the *result* object will be returned by the traversal.\n\nFor successful traversals, the returned JSON object has the following properties:\n- *error*: boolean flag to indicate if an error occurred (*false* in this case)\n- *code*: the HTTP status code\n- *result*: the return value of the traversal\nIf the traversal specification is either missing or malformed, the server will respond with *HTTP 400*.\n\nThe body of the response will then contain a JSON object with additional error details.
